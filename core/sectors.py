----------
A bank of sector "expectations".

The whole point of this project is that a Debt/Equity of 2.0 is alarming for a
software company and completely normal for a bank or an infrastructure
developer. So instead of one universal rule book, every sector carries its own
thresholds and its own weightings.

Each sector profile holds:
  benchmarks : metric -> (weak_below, strong_above)  ... on the metric's own scale
  weights    : how much each analysis pillar matters for this sector
  notes      : plain-English context shown in the UI and given to the LLM
