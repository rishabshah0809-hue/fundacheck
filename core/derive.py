---------
Compute the benchmark ratios from the raw statements when the workbook does not
supply them.

Why this exists: a "Ratio Analysis" sheet is usually a grid of formulas. If the
file was written by a tool that did not cache the results (or the sheet was
renamed, or the ratios are named differently), reading it yields nothing and the
whole analysis dies with "none of the benchmark ratios could be found" — even
though every input needed to compute them is sitting in the income statement and
balance sheet next door.

So: anything the workbook provides is trusted and used as-is. Anything missing
is derived here, from the statements, using the standard definition.
